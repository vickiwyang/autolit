1. Sending a post request (posting some data to my database) without redirecting or refreshing the page.
- Current workaround: redirected to same page
2. Sending requests to an external API within my route handler
- Current workaround: request package (deprecated) => node-fetch
3. Middleware and callback hell
- Was I doing too much in my middleware? Did I have too many middlewares in the server request?
