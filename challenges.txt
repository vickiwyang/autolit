1. Sending a post request (posting some data to my database) without redirecting or refreshing the page.
- Current workaround: redirected to same page
2. Sending requests to an external API within my route handler
- Current workaround: request package (deprecated) => node-fetch
3. Middleware and callback hell
- Was I doing too much in my middleware? Did I have too many middlewares in the server request?
4. Challenges: Getting React to fetch and render my data correctly
- Since the fetch call was in componentDidMount, subsequent inputs weren't updating the rendered view. Current workaround is to have React call fetch and re-render every second, but I don't think that's very efficient (why query my database if the input hasn't changed?)
- Figured out conditional styling of "dumb" (stateless) React components
